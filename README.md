## Learning identifiable and interpretable latent models of high-dimensional neural activity using pi-VAE

This code implements pi-VAE, VAE and all the examples in paper.

To check source code for pi-VAE and VAE, see folder ./code/

To check examples in paper, see folder ./examples/

We are working on adding more comments to the code.

## Data
You can find ways to simulate data in ./examples/simulate_data.ipynb. You can find the rat hippocampus data in https://portal.nersc.gov/project/crcns/download/hc-11/data/. We use session Achilles_10252013.
